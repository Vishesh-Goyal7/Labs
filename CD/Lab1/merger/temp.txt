Module 2
Message Passing Interface Model
1) Underlying hardware is assumed to be a collection of processors each with local memory
2) Processor has direct access only to instruction and data stored in its own local memory. 
3) An interconnection network supports the exchanging of messaging. 
4) User specifies number of concurrent processes when the program begins and number of active processes remain constant throughout execution of program
5) Every process executes the same program but because each subprocess has unique id, they can be coded to perform different operations on the data
6) MPI run well on MIMD architectures making them natural fit for multicomputers. 
7) High cache hit rate when executing on multiprocessing leading to good performance.
